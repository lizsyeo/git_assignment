a. What is an issue?
An issue is a way for us to track tasks or bugs to a repo. It allows us to view them all in a central repository.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request allows developers to propose changes to a repository without actually changing the main branch. It allows developers to collaborate and review each other's code before making the modifications.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
To open a pull request, navigate to the branch you want to make the changes on and click on the "pull request" tab. Create "new pull request" and select the branch containing your changes.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
You can add someone as a collaborator by going to the settings tab on gihub and add their username or email.


e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, work with others, propose changes and manage different versions of their projects and changes locally. 
Github is a web-based platform based on Git, it allows developers to host repositories, collaborate with others via pull requests, issues, and etc.

f. What does git diff do?
It shows the differences between the two repositories i.e. changes made to the files between commits, branches or the directory. It is helpful for reviewing changes before commiting them and review conflicts.


g. What is the main branch?
It is the default master branch and is used as the default branch where all the other branches will merge into with their changes.


h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
We should not directly push our changes directly into the main branch to avoid breaking the code. We should create a new branch for each new feature, review bugs,issues and commit changes on that branch, open a pull request to merge those changes into the main branch after a review.
